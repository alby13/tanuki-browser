## üìñ Introduction

The Tanuki Text Web Browser is a lightweight, secure, and privacy-focused text-based web browser. Designed with simplicity, features, and security in mind, it allows you to browse many websites using a unique approach to rendering websites in text.

### ‚≠ê Key Features

- Native security by nature
- Strict no-data-collection policy
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux and Windows)

## ü™ü Installation for Windows

We provide a easy pre-compiled executable for Windows users. Note: A security warning is 'normal' because Windows charges hundreds of dollars for a security certificate.
